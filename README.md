# Models-and-Simulation-Project
Airport car simulator built upon CSIM, a process-oriented discrete event simulation package built upon C.


Each car in the simuation starts at the speed of 0, and each car is assigned a max speed ranging from 1 to 5. 
There is also one traffic signal in the terminal that changes on a set interval. 
The cars come to a full stop when the traffic signal is red. 


Adjusting the Simulator: 

The simulator will output the average speed, wait time, and number of cars that have circled around the terminal. 
* To adjust the run time of the simulation you must change the SIMULATIONTIME macro.
* To adjust the number of cards, change the NUMCARS macro.
* To adjust the number of road blocks, change the NUMROADS macro.
